# Strategy & Product Portfolio – Kaushike Ramanathan

This repository showcases my work across **strategy, product thinking, and analytics**:
- Product management case studies
- Hackathon pitch decks

These projects reflect how I **structure ambiguous problems**, design **data-driven solutions**, and communicate them through **clear, consulting-style decks**.

This repository contains selected **strategy, product, UX, and problem-solving projects**, compiled from Smart India Hackathon, real product assignments, and strategic UX case studies.  
All project files are uploaded as **PDFs** inside this repository.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:  
- Frame ambiguous problems clearly  
- Identify measurable KPIs and data points  
- Structure solutions using consulting frameworks  
- Design user flows and system architecture  
- Build compelling presentation decks  
- Communicate insights crisply through visuals  
- Think analytically, strategically, and user-first

- ## 🧠 My Strategic Approach (Consistent Across All Work)

1. **Problem Framing**  
   Break ambiguity into structured, solvable components.

2. **KPI-Driven Thinking**  
   Identify measurable indicators that reflect true performance.

3. **User-Centred Thinking**  
   Blend behavioural psychology, UX flows, and real constraints.

4. **Solution Architecture**  
   High-level systems, flows, and interactions that make sense end-to-end.

5. **Clear Storytelling**  
   Decks that communicate problem → insights → solution → impact.
